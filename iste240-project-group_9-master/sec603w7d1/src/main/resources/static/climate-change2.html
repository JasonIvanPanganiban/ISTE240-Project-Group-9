        <h1 style="font-weight: bolder;">What is climate change? A really simple guide</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, posing serious threats to people and nature.</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Things are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue urgent action can still limit the worst effects of climate change.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The world has been warming up quickly over the past 100 years or so. As a result, weather patterns are changing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Between 2015 and 2024, global temperatures were on average around 1.28C above those of the late 19th Century, according to the European <span> Copernicus climate service </span>, external. </p>
        <br>     
        <p>Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, the UK Met Office says.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The year 2024 was the world's hottest on record, with climate change mainly responsible for the high temperatures.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It was also the first calendar year to surpass 1.5C of warming compared to pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How are humans causing climate change?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The climate has changed naturally throughout the Earth's history.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen over the last century, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). </p>
        <br>
        <p><span> This has been caused by human activities </span>, in particular the widespread use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport systems.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). This CO2 acts like a blanket, trapping extra energy in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface. This causes the planet to heat up.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - <span> the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by about 50% </span>, external, far above levels seen in the Earth's recent history.</p>
        <br>    
        <p><span> The CO2 released from burning fossil fuels </span> , external has a distinctive chemical fingerprint. This matches the type of CO2 increasingly found in the atmosphere.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What effects of climate change have already been seen?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Climate change has already had a huge effect on the environment, including:</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; more frequent and intense <span> extreme weather </span>, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; rapid melting of <span> glaciers </span> and <span> ice sheets </span>, contributing to sea-level rise</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; huge declines in <span> Arctic sea-ice </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; <span> warmer oceans </span>, which can fuel <span> more intense storms and hurricanes </span> and damage wildlife such as <span> coral reefs </span></p>
        <br>
        <p>These changes are already having serious consequences for people and economies around the world.
        <br>
        <p>For example, Hurricanes Helene and Milton - which hit parts of the US in September and October 2024 - could each end up costing at least $50bn <span> (£40bn) </span>, external, according to provisional estimates.</p>
        <br>
        <p>More than 200 people were killed by Helene, and at least 16 by Milton.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The winds and rain from both storms were worsened by climate change, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Back in 2022, parts of East Africa suffered their worst drought for 40 years, putting more than 20 million people at risk of severe hunger.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Climate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more likely, the WWA says.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The particular vulnerabilities of individual communities across the globe determine who is affected by these extreme events, and how badly.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why does 1.5C matter and how will future climate change affect the world?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The more the world warms, the worse the impacts of climate change become.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Limiting long-term average temperature rises to 1.5C <span> is seen as particularly important </span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In a <span> landmark agreement signed in Paris in 2015 </span>, almost 200 countries pledged to try to curb global warming to that amount. The reference to 1.5C is generally understood to mean a 20-year average, rather than an increase seen in any single year.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The science is not completely certain, but according to the UN, the <span> consequences of 2C global warming versus 1.5C could include: </span></p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; <span> extreme hot days </span> could become on average 4C warmer at mid-latitudes (regions outside the poles and tropics), versus 3C at 1.5C</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; <span> sea-level rise </span> could be around 0.1m higher than at 1.5C, exposing up to 10 million more people to events including more frequent flooding</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; more than 99% of <span> coral reefs </span> could be lost, compared with 70-90% at 1.5C</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; twice the number of <span> plants and vertebrates </span> (animals with a backbone) could be exposed to unsuitable climate conditions across more than half their geographical area</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; several hundred million more <span> people </span> may be exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by 2050 than at 1.5C.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The call to restrict temperature rise to 1.5C was partly designed to avoid crossing so-called "tipping points".</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is not clear exactly where they sit, but once these thresholds are passed, changes could accelerate and become irreversible, such as the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>About 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to the IPCC.</p>
        <br>
        <p>People living in poorer countries are expected to suffer most as they have fewer resources to adapt.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This has led to questions about fairness, because <span> these places have typically only been responsible for a small percentage of greenhouse gas emissions</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, knock-on impacts could be felt over wide areas. For example, crop failures linked to extreme weather could raise global food prices.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are governments doing about climate change?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>To help keep global warming to the 1.5C limit agreed in Paris in 2015, CO2 emissions need to be "<span>net zero</span>" by 2050, the UN says.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and actively removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most <span> countries have, or are considering, net zero targets</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, greenhouse gas levels are still rising quickly and the world is "likely" to warm beyond 1.5C, the IPCC says.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, there has been <span> progress in some areas</span>, such as the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the most recent COP29 summit in November 2024, <span> richer countries committed to giving developing nations at least $300bn</span> (about £240bn) a year by 2035 to help them tackle climate change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, this is far less than the amount poorer countries say they need.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Many countries had also hoped that <span> the deal struck in 2023</span> to "transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems" would be strengthened, but that did not happen.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What can individuals do about climate change?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; taking <span>fewer flights</span> </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; <span>using less energy</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; improving their home's <span>insulation</span> and energy efficiency</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; switching to electric vehicles or living car-free</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; replacing gas central heating with electric systems like <span>heat pumps</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; eating<span> leass red meat</span> </p>
